# congressional_morality
So, it's not really a surprise that the party of "family values" has been caught in more immoral situations. I'm a firm believer that the loudest critic/bigot is usually fueld by shame. However, I wanted to visualize this difference. With the help of ChatGPT I put this dashboard together as a quick project. There is a lot of potential improvements, but it serves its purpose for now.
